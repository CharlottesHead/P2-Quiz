## Usage
Upon opening the app one is greeted immediately with the opportunity to begin the quiz. I chose to forgo username and sign-ups as this is often seen as a privacy concern and thus deters many users from such a website. Progress through the quiz is shown throughout the duration of the quiz, but the score is hidden until completion. At this stage, to encourage return visitors, correct answers will not be shown at the end of the quiz but it may be a feature added in the future along with more questions.


## Project Status
